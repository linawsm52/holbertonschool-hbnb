# Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

This document provides documentation for the sequence diagrams that describe API interactions within the system.
Each diagram illustrates how requests flow between the User, API, Service, and Database layers.

## 1. User Registration

### Description
This sequence diagram illustrates the process of registering a new user.

### Flow
1. The user sends a POST request to `/users` through the API.
2. The API forwards the request to the service layer to validate user data.
3. The service saves the user information in the database.
4. The database returns a success response.
5. The service notifies the API that the user has been created.
6. The API responds to the user with `201 Created`.

### Purpose
To visualize the interaction between system components during user registration.

## 2. Place Creation

### Description
This sequence diagram explains how a new place is created in the system.

### Flow
1. The user sends a POST request to `/places`.
2. The API forwards the request to the service layer for validation.
3. The service stores the place data in the database.
4. The database confirms successful storage.
5. The service notifies the API that the place was created.
6. The API responds with `201 Created`.

### Purpose
To demonstrate how place data is validated and stored.

## 3. Review Submission

### Description
This sequence diagram represents the review submission process.

### Flow
1. The user sends a POST request to submit a review.
2. The API forwards the request to the service layer.
3. The service validates and saves the review in the database.
4. The database returns a success response.
5. The service informs the API that the review has been saved.
6. The API sends a confirmation response to the user.

### Purpose
To illustrate how reviews are processed and stored.

## 4. Fetch Places

### Description
This sequence diagram shows how places are retrieved from the system.

### Flow
1. The user sends a GET request to retrieve places.
2. The API forwards the request to the service layer.
3. The service requests the places data from the database.
4. The database returns the list of places.
5. The service sends the data back to the API.
6. The API responds to the user with the places list.
