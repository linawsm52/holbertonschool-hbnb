# HBnB Evolution – Technical Design Document

## 1. Introduction
This part focuses on creating comprehensive technical documentation for the HBnB Evolution application. The goal is to provide a clear and detailed blueprint that will guide the implementation phases in later parts of the project.  

This documentation describes the system architecture, business logic design, and interactions between components using UML diagrams.

### 1.a Scope
This documentation covers:  
- System architecture design  
- Business logic modeling  
- Documentation of entities and relationships  

**Purpose:**  
To provide developers with a clear reference for how the system is structured, how components interact, and how business rules are enforced.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### 2.a Architecture Overview
The application follows a **three-layer architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer:**  
   - Handles user interactions and API requests.  
   - Example: Receiving HTTP requests from a web or mobile client.

2. **Business Logic Layer:**  
   - Contains core models, entities, and business rules.  
   - Example: Validating user inputs, managing bookings, calculating ratings.

3. **Persistence Layer:**  
   - Responsible for data storage and retrieval.  
   - Example: Storing user accounts, listings, and reviews in the database.  

**Benefits of this architecture:**  
- Separation of concerns  
- Easier maintenance and testing  
- Scalability and modularity
