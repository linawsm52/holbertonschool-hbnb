# HBnB Evolution – Part 1: Technical Documentation

## Objective
This part focuses on creating comprehensive technical documentation for the HBnB Evolution application. The goal is to provide a clear and detailed blueprint that will guide the implementation phases in later parts of the project.

This documentation describes the system architecture, business logic design, and interactions between components using UML diagrams.

## Scope
Part 1 covers:
- System architecture design
- Business logic modeling
- Documentation of entities and relationships


## Architecture Overview
The application follows a **three-layer architecture**:
1. **Presentation Layer** – Handles user interaction and API requests
2. **Business Logic Layer** – Contains core models and business rules
3. **Persistence Layer** – Responsible for data storage and retrieval

## Included Documentation
This part includes the following UML diagrams:

### 1. High-Level Package Diagram
- Illustrates the three-layer architecture
- Shows communication between layers using the facade pattern

### 2. Business Logic Class Diagram
- Models the core entities:
  - User
  - Place
  - Review
  - Amenity
- Includes attributes, methods, relationships, and constraints

### 3. Sequence Diagrams
Sequence diagrams for key API flows:
- sequence 1
- sequence 2
- sequence 3
- sequence 4
